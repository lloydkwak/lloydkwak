## 🔬 Research Interests
I am fascinated by **intelligence that manifests in the physical world.** My goal is to understand and build autonomous agents where reasoning is not just an abstract computation, but a visible behavior that emerges through interaction with reality.

* **Physically Grounded Intelligence:** Moving beyond static data to create agents that perceive, move, and interact within complex environments.
* **Emergent Behavior & Dynamics:** Exploring how sophisticated, life-like actions arise from fundamental rules and structural evolution.
* **Adaptive Interaction:** Investigating the continuous loop between an agent’s internal model and the external world to achieve robust, real-time adaptation.
